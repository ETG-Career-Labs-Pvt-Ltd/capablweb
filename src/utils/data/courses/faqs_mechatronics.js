    question: "What is ROS and how is it used in Mechatronics?",
    answer:
      "ROS stands for Robot Operating System and is an open-source software framework that is used to develop robot applications. It provides a set of tools and libraries that can be used to create complex robot systems. In Mechatronics, ROS can be used to develop control systems for robots and to create software that allows the robot to interact with its environment.",

    question: "How does AI and ML relate to Mechatronics?",
    answer:
      "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are two fields that are closely related to Mechatronics. They involve the development of algorithms and software that can be used to make machines and robots more intelligent and adaptable. In Mechatronics, AI and ML can be used to create robots that can learn from their environment, adapt to changing conditions, and make decisions based on the data they collect.",
